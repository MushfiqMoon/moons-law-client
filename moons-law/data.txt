Dispute Resolution
=====================

A starting point with dispute resolution can be negotiation. Both sides seek to find common ground on a dispute. This could be internal grievances around employment or director responsibilities, or disputes with 3rd parties, such as trading partners and investors. Considering the view taken by the opposing party is key. But sometimes the differences are too broad and the negotiation process fails. This leads to other dispute resolution remedies being considered. Mediation is a process by which the parties involved in the dispute come together, but with an independent party present - the mediator - who tries to help the disputing parties come to a resolution that both sides can live with. The mediator is impartial and it is not their role to come to a decision, but rather to help both sides agree to a resolution. Mediation is not as formal as the arbitration and litigation processes and as a result, it is usually much cheaper. In mediation, a settlement agreement is drafted after a resolution, detailing what both sides have agreed to comply with. Arbitration is a more formal legal process. This uses an independent arbitrator to make a decision about the dispute. All parties provide evidence and the arbitrator uses this information to come to a conclusion, seeking to resolve the dispute. This form of dispute resolution allows all parties to have an influence on the process. As there are no court-imposed deadlines, it can be more flexible. It is also generally cheaper than litigation. Arbitration decisions are legally binding and they are generally able to be enforced in a similar way to court judgments, so taking legal advice is highly recommended If the more informal dispute resolution methods fail, then going to court may be the only option remaining. Litigation is when a dispute resolution Solicitor is enlisted to help resolve the dispute, giving expert advice on the best approach. Dispute resolution Solicitors will deal with court proceedings and manage all the documentation throughout the process. Litigation is usually the most expensive form of dispute resolution. If it goes in court, it is likely that the other side will have also taken expert legal advice.

Personal Injury
=====================

Personal injury law, or sometimes referred to as tort law, covers cases where a person is hurt or injured, as a result of someone else’s negligence. This is a form of civil law, which means one private party is suing another, unlike criminal law where the government prosecutes someone. In these suits the injury may not have even been caused by a crime, just simple carelessness. Lawsuits can help the injured person collect damages, which can help cover medical bills or lost wages from the injury. More often than not in the realm of personal injury law, cases are settled before the trial phase of the legal proceeding. Instead of trial, the two parties and their lawyers discuss the issue and agree on a settlement. If the case does go to trial it may be heard by a judge and a jury, or a judge alone.  In this case they are responsible for determining the extent to which each party is liable and calculating a fair amount of damages for the incident. Personal injury makes up the largest category of civil lawsuits, mainly because it covers such a wide range of situations; anywhere from falling at work to medical malpractice. Representing over half of personal injury cases each year, car accidents are the most common cause of injury lawsuits. Car accident cases are the kinds of cases where the plaintiff, or injured person, is most likely to be successful, and they result in a median award of $16,000. Car accidents can include collisions between two drivers, or incidents where a driver hits a pedestrian or biker.

Corporate Service
=====================

Corporate law (also known as business law, company law or enterprise law) is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation.[1] It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation. While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by share ownership, capital market, and business culture rules differ, similar legal characteristics and legal problems exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how corporations, investors, shareholders, directors, employees, creditors, and other stakeholders such as consumers, the community, and the environment interact with one another.[1] Whilst the term company or business law is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, the term business law mostly refers to wider concepts of commercial law, that is the law relating to commercial and business related purposes and activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or financial law. When used as a substitute for corporate law, business law means the law relating to the business corporation (or business enterprises), including such activity as raising capital, company formation, and registration with the government.

Employment Law
=====================

With a population of 168.1 million people, Bangladesh has a huge and cheap workforce of about 90 million, consisting of 60 million agricultural jobs (growing at one percent per year) and 30 million non-agricultural jobs (growing at six percent per annum). Industrial jobs fall mostly within non-agricultural work. All employers are required to follow federal labor laws that prescribe conditions of employment, working hours, salary levels, leave policies, health and health conditions, and insurance for injured workers. Bangladesh constitution guarantees freedom of association and the right to join unions in it’s jurisdiction of Employee Rights & Labour Law in Bangladesh.  The 2006 Bangladesh Labor Act is relatively sweeping and progressive. The Act consolidates and replaces the 25 existing acts. The comprehensive nature of the law can immediately be gleaned from its coverage — conditions of service and employment, youth employment, maternity benefit, health hygiene, safety, welfare, working hours and leave, wages and payment, workers’ compensation for injury, trade unions and industrial relations, disputes, labour court, workers’ participation in companies profits, regulation of employment and safety of dock workers, provident funds, apprenticeship, penalty and procedure, administration, inspection, etc.

Family Law
=====================

A civil union (also known as a civil partnership) is a legally recognized arrangement similar to marriage, created primarily as a means to provide recognition in law for same-sex couples. Civil unions grant some or all of the rights of marriage except child adoption and/or the title itself. Civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several, mostly developed, countries in order to provide legal recognition of relationships formed by unmarried same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, tax breaks, and responsibilities similar or identical to those of legally married couples. In 1989, Denmark was the first country to legalise civil unions, for same-sex couples; however most other developed democracies did not begin establishing civil unions until the 1990s or early 2000s, often developing them from less formal domestic partnerships. While civil unions are often established for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples, in a number of countries they are available to same-sex couples only. In Brazil, civil unions were first created for opposite-sex couples in 2002, and then expanded to include same-sex couples through a supreme court ruling in 2011. In the majority of countries that established same-sex civil unions, they have since been either supplemented or replaced by same-sex marriage. Civil unions are viewed by LGBT rights campaigners as a "first step" towards establishing same-sex marriage, as civil unions are viewed by supporters of LGBT rights as a "separate but equal" or "second class" status. Many jurisdictions with civil unions recognize foreign unions if those are essentially equivalent to their own; for example, the United Kingdom lists equivalent unions in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 Schedule 20. The marriages of same-sex couples performed abroad may be recognized as civil unions in jurisdictions that only have the latter.

Car Accident Law
=====================

Car accident law refers to the legal rules that determine who is responsible for the personal and property damage resulting from a traffic collision. This area of the law consists of the principles of negligence, as applied to this particular category of personal injury cases. Like other cases in which negligence law applies, car accident litigation is governed almost entirely by state law. While nuances exist, car accident victims in every state must prove the same basic four elements in order to recover compensation. These elements are: duty, breach, causation, and harm. With respect to duty, drivers have a legal obligation to obey the rules of the road and to operate their vehicles in a reasonable manner. This means driving a safe speed, maintaining control, exercising awareness, observing traffic signals, using blinkers and headlights, etc. The existence of a duty is typically accepted without much argument. By contrast, the plaintiff will usually be required to offer evidence that the defendant breached that duty. Breach can be shown by direct evidence, such as eyewitness testimony, traffic surveillance video, or an admission of fault. Or, the plaintiff may need to resort to circumstantial evidence, such as skid marks, paint smudges, or blood alcohol readings. Just because the defendant had a duty to operate his or her vehicle in a certain manner, and it is shown that the defendant breached that duty, the court will not assume those circumstances caused the plaintiff's injuries. Rather, the plaintiff must prove the element of causation. In car accident cases, this can be done through medical testimony demonstrating the injuries are consistent with the nature of the crash, and that they did not exist beforehand.
